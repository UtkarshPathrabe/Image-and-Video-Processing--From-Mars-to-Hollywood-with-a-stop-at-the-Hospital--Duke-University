Question 01
-----------  
What shapes have constant Euclidean curvature?  

### Answer  
Straight lines and Circles.  

### Explanation  
The Euclidean curvature is zero for straight lines, and 1/radius for circles.  

Question 02
-----------  
The gradient of a function f(x,y) is  

### Answer  
Perpendicular to the level lines of f(x,y).  

### Explanation  
This is shown in the video when we discussed level sets and implicit representations, and we proved such result.  

Question 03
-----------  
Consider the functional (Integral|Del I|p) for an image I(x,y) and p   > 0. For which p the Euler-Lagrange of the functional will lead to anisotropic diffusion?  

### Answer  
p = 1.  

### Explanation  
We have seen that for p = 1 this gives "curvature motion", a type of anisotropic diffusion. For p = 2 this gives the isotropic diffusion or heat flow. For p > 2 we also get additional diffusion across edges instead of reduced diffusion.  

Question 04
-----------  
Considering a planar curve C embedded as the zero level set of a function f(x,y). The curve moves with constant velocity. Then f(x,y) is deforming according to  

### Answer  
ft=|Del f|.  

### Explanation  
We have demonstrated that the general motion is ft = V * |Del f| when the curve is moving with speed V in the normal direction. In this case (constant motion) V = 1.  

Question 05
-----------  
Consider a circle of radius 1/8. What is the relationship between the affine arc-length dv and the Euclidean arc-length ds for this circle?  

### Answer  
dv = 2 * ds.  

### Explanation  
We have that dv = $\kappa$ ^ (1 / 3) ds, and since the radius is 1/8, the curvature $\kappa$ is 8.  

Question 06
-----------  
Consider a planar shape in an image, with its boundary deforming with only tangential velocity. What will happen to the object inside such boundary?  

### Answer  
It will not change.  

Question 07
-----------  
Considering an image with only circular objects of known radius. Which of the following techniques would you use to detect their centers:  

### Answer  
Hough transform.
